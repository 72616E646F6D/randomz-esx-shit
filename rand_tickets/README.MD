# ESX Ticket System

> A very simple and straightforward ticket system resource.
>Makes things a bit more organised and simpler for the admins on your server.

**For the resource to work properly, you have to change the notification and chat events in client/server side to the ones you use.** 

Please don't mind the bad indentation as GitHub fucks it up xd
